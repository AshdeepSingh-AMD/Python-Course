# Iris Dataset Predictions
The file named 'Iris Dataset Predictions' contained the code applied with iris_dataset.

The code use 5 alogorithms to test and train model.The algorithms are --
        * DecisionTreeClassifier          * SVM             * LinearRegression                
        * RandomForestClassifier          * NaiveByes       * LogisticRegression
        
Using above algorithms I made my own train_test_split method and check the accuracy of my own.

I have used a function named "model_prediction" which takes the Algorithm and then print accuracy of that model based on our iris dataset.

# Sample OUTPUT:
    Accuracy of DecisionTreeClassifier : 93%
    Accuracy of LinearRegression : 63%
    Accuracy of LogisticRegression : 93%
    Accuracy of GaussianNB : 93%
    Accuracy of RandomForestClassifier : 93%
    Accuracy of SupportVectorClassifier : 95%
